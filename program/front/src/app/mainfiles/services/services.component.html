        <p style="font-size: 20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) conducts and sponsors a number of innovative demonstration projects to test and measure the effect of potential program changes. Our demonstrations study the likely impact of new methods of service delivery, coverage of new types of service, and new payment approaches on beneficiaries, providers, health plans, states, and the Medicare Trust Funds. Evaluation projects validate our research and demonstration findings and help us monitor the effectiveness of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

            This website provides archived content for Medicare Demonstration Projects & Evaluation Reports that were active from 1995 to 2012.  We are providing this archived content as a resource for high-quality and relevant health policy research, through transparency of healthcare data and analytics.
                     
            Maintaining an expanding portfolio dating from 2010 to present day, the CMS Innovation Center contributes reports and datasets to the community of health care innovators, data researchers, and policy analysts, among others, supporting the development and testing of innovative health care payment and service delivery models. </p>
